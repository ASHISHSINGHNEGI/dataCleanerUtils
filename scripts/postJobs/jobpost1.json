        "description": "Dolores Agnes Fuller (née Eble, later Chamberlin; March 10, 1923 – May 9, 2011[2]) was an American actress and songwriter. Beginning her career as a child actress, she made her acting debut in the romantic comedy film It Happened One Night (1934). Nearly two decades later, she had lead and supporting roles in films such as Glen or Glenda (1953), Jail Bait (1954), and Bride of the Monster (1955), all of which were written and directed by her then-boyfriend Ed Wood. After Fuller ended her relationship with Wood in 1955, she began a successful career as a songwriter, in which many of her songs were performed and recorded by Elvis Presley.",
